Loan Default Predictor: This project involved building a Deep Learning model (Neural Network) to predict if a loan from a large dataset would be fully repaid or default (charged off).

The work involved heavily cleaning and preparing the complex financial data (Feature Engineering), before training the model to learn the patterns that lead to repayment or default, ultimately providing a tool for risk assessment.
