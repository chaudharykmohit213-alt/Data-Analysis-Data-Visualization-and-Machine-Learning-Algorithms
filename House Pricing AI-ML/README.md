This project involved building a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using Keras to predict house prices in King County, USA. The process included Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering (time-based features), and MinMaxScaler preprocessing. The trained model was a sequential neural network optimized with adam and evaluated using regression metrics like RMSE and MAE, successfully predicting house values.
